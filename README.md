A Drone Detector using MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox to detect drones using CNN, RCNN, and YOLOv2. And using Python's opencv to detect the drone using a custom haarcascade and a laser turret consisting of a pan-tilt servo motors.

#Instructions:

    1)customHC.rar : Contains the positive samples, negative samples, positives vector file, and background file in addition to the custom haarcasecade.
    2)MATLAB.rar : a rar file that contains the MATLAB codes in addition to the image datastores. The items inside the rar file should ne added to the path in MATLAB upon usage.
    3)sampleVid_trim.mp4 : a video file that can be used for training the drone detector if training data is not available.
    4)trackDrone.py : The python code that detects the drone using a custom haarcascade and two servo motors to locate the drone.
    5)Instructions and Troubleshoot.pdf : PDF report that contains a guide on how to use the project with troubleshooting steps in case of facing troubles in the installation process or using the project.
